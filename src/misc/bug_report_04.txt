blanco ingame, go:
-when enabling r_showViewEntitys & r_showTris we see some wireframes. are we missing light?

-or, let's start by backtracking r_showViewEntitys & r_showTris.
-also look at the warnings like "rigid body moved outside world bounds for entity..." & "clip model outside world bounds for entity..."
	-DBG_DropToFloorAndRest = 966
	-idPhysics_RigidBody::DropToFloorAndRest() is only called 110 times in the original and 591 in our fake version
		-idClip::Contents() returns no nzero
			-collisionModelManager.Contents()
		-ok, so the japanese version is printing more values, which means somewhere a conditional is misfiring
			-will this help us, no idea, just roll with it
			-printing the values of current.i.position in Evaluate() is already yielding more results
				-so the correct value is set in SetOrigin(), which means that this object shouldn't be in the linked list.
	-idPhysics_Monster::DBG_Evaluate == 1278
		-self.name.equals("marscity_cinematic_betruger_1")
			-this one is triggered during idSessionLocal::StartNewGame() in the translation, but not the original
		-idGameLocal::RunFrame() --> activeEntities.Next() returns wrong value after Next().Next()
			-idGameLocal::SortActiveEntityList() --> activeEntities.next.owner is the same,
			 but activeEntities.prev.owner is different. 
				-good 2087, bad 2093
				-2093 is added to the linkedlist twice..the second being in BecomeActive() originating at SetupWeaponEntity()
					-which is added in idEntity::BecomeActive()
					-2087 is the max loaded by the original, anything afterwards isn't supposed to be
						-the same idGameLocal::RegisterEntity() call scores 2081 in the original, 2087 in the imitation.
							-idGameLocal.entities[] seems to have nulls and values at different locations
							-some entities are being spawned with the same spawn_entnum
								-idGameLocal::SpawnMapEntities() 67, 68
								-firstFreeIndex++
								-105 is unregistered in the original. idGameLocal::UnregisterEntity()
									-in da ~idEntity() deconstructor...who would have thought deconstructors would serve this much purpose.
					-fixed, but still no ingame shit. . .
	-back to backtracking from the warnings.
		-so the idClipModel.origin values are out of whack, especially the Z.
			-printed out all 2064 origins.
			-they seem to match at first glance
		-idPhysics_Base::IsOutsideWorld()->GetAbsBounds() returns zeroes in the original, but weird arzse values in the jafa.
			-feels like we're going in circles, but we should've been checking idClipModel.absBounds instead of origin.
			-let's start by printing out the classnames
				-the jafa version prints out 880 names vs 254 in the cpp.
					-a total of 4 instances in the cpp version though.
						-wrong moron!
					-is the teamChain part in idEntity::RunPhysics() fucked up?
						-						cpp jj
						 idEntity::QuitTeam()  	  7	 6
						 idEntity::JoinTeam()	205	97
						 idEntity::Unbind()		207	98
						-func_door_17 is the last common idEntity(), then there's a gap, and then player1_head
							-idEvent::ServiceEvents()
							-idEntity::Event_SpawnBind(), we're missing callbacks(missing being the understatement of the year)
								-idEvent::Schedule()
									-idClass::PostEventArgs()
										idTypeInfo::Init() for c.eventMap[]
										-idClass::ProcessEventArgPtr()
										-plan:
											static methods
											give object as param	- ServiceEvents
											varargs object			- ProcessEventArgPtr
											varargs[0] is object 	- ProcessEventArgPtr
							-took some effort to fix this(417 from 419 now), moving on
			-back to checking idClipModel.absBounds
				-clipmodel.DBG_count==11
				-which is set in idClipModel::Link() #44
					-which is set in idPhysics_RigidBody::DropToFloorAndRest()...didn't see that one coming
						-neither tr.endpos or current.i.orientation match
							-we should begin with current.i.position though
								-idPhysics_RigidBody::SetOrigin()
									-seems like we're comparing oranges and potatoes
									-we were comparing #97 & #98 in idGameLocal::RunFrame()
										-it seems #97 moveable_fireext_1, has one too many flags
											-idEntity::BecomeInactive() isn't hit in our version
											-plus our version is setting more flags, albe they the same
                                                -same flags
                                            -idMoveable::Spawn(), physicsObj.centerOfMass has different values

						-::DeriveUnsmoothedTangents(), verts match, but dominantTris don't
					-our version is printing out a shitload more xyz, almost tenfold
						-we were printing the wrong function, it's still 25% more though.
							-just had an idea to disable ConvertLWOToModelSurfaces(), and naturally the planet disappears, but also some of the ingame wireframes. 
							 Most surprising, is the fact that some of the wireframes seem to be moving now.
							 but we STILL can't move, meaning something is wrong with our input.
							 -however, the cpp version is crashing...why isn't ours crashing?
							 -let's try isolating the spinning wireframe, and see if we can move it
